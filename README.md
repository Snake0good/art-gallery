# Optimizations

There are a few things that can be optimized. Here are a few I know. 
- Speed. Right now, the EJS is good but when files get larger and with low internet speed, it slows down
- Comments. I have some files set aside to add comments, I just haven't added them here with CSS
- Design. It's okay for now, but I'd like to sit down and look through to see how to make it better.
